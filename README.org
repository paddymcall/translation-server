#+TITLE: Docker Zotero Translation Server for EAST

To see the differences, extract the content from the image like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  id=$(docker create translation-server)
  docker cp $id:/opt/translation-server - > /tmp/trl-server-docker.tar
  docker rm -v $id
#+END_SRC


The archive ~/tmp/trl-server-docker.tar~ will then contain the
~./build/~ directory, which you can diff against the standard
(non-dockerized) ~./build/~.  You can also run the translation server
(on a sufficiently similar system) from the archive, with
~./build/run_translation-server.sh~.
